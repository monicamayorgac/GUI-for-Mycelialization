## Fungal Growth Analysis Tool

## Overview
This project is a computer vision tool designed to analyze the growth rate of fungus in a controlled environment. It processes images taken from multiple angles (front, back, left, right, bottom) and calculates the percentage of fungal colonization based on color thresholding.

This tool was developed to assist in tracking growth stages (Day 1, 3, 7, 14) without manual estimation.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need Python installed. We recommend using a Conda environment.

### Dependencies
